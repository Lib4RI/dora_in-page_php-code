## Technical background:<tt>
	The DORA Content Policy is an unique set of rules authoritative
	for all Lib4RI institutes (Eawag, Empa PSI, WSL).
	Technical approach is to offer a link to this policy on each
	sub-site with institute specific naming and references though,
	but internally/technically using one and the same policy document
	which is intended to reside on the commonly shared 'data' folder.
</tt>

## Work steps:
* To prepare your policy document:<tt>
	- MS Word: Open the policy document in Word.
	- Save it as 'filtered' HTML in \\eaw-projects\Lib4RI_DORA_archive$\all\
	- Also save there the policy document as PDF.
</tt>
* To create the content node/page in the Drupal CMS.<tt>
	- Select 'Add content', select 'Basic Page'
	- Select 'PHP edit mode' + copy the PHP-code into the textarea.
	- Optionally show a menu link as wanted
	- Assign the alias dora_content_policy (required).
	- Redo these Drupal steps for all sub-sites.
</tt>

## Issues/Hints:<tt>
	- Currently there is not auto-detection of the newest policy document
	  in the commonly shared 'data' folder, and you have to update information
	  of the file names on top of the PHP in-page code.
	- MS Word may add many unneeded/useless formatting which can disturb
	  the parsing the HTML file. A short recheck of the produced HTML file
	  is recommended.
	- Layout: The style of the original policy document may not really be in
	  sync with the style of the Drupal website, as test you can try it out:
		- Original document CSS widely removed (default):
		  http://www.dora-dev.lib4ri.ch/eawag/dora_content_policy?css=none
		- Original document CSS widely maintained:
		  http://www.dora-dev.lib4ri.ch/eawag/dora_content_policy?css=orig
		- Proprietary CSS tuning:
